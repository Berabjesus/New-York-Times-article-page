                  <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist 
                    named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, 
                    stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond 
                    the world of known physics.</p>
                  <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                     particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead 
                     he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
                     A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
                      have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a 
                      repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the 
                      speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the 
                    heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
                     mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and 
                     irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted 
                     beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <q>SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,</q> Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
                     and drew a double box around it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they 
                    had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, 
                    known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with
                    telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of 
                    the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric
                    of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe 
                    being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth 
                    of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of 
                    inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

                <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, 
                    including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science 
                  comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe 
                  apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and 
                  space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 
                  billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, 
                  is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture 
                  and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might 
                  be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, 
                  like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
                <h2><strong>'As Big as It Gets'</strong></h2>
                <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating
                   at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth
                   and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be
                    the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
                    Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
                <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert 
                  who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending 
                  a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
                <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
                   microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the
                    universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
                <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep,
                   for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported
                    their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
                    here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
